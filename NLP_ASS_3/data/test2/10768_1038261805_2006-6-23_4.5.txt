The best about this hotel is service.  Even much better than many 5-star hotels.  They are very attentive and efficient.  I stayed in single room.  It is very small but only $308 I have nothing to complain about.  The breakfast was great also.  The only bad thing is they don't have swimming pool or gym, otherwise I think it will be a 5-star hotel!
