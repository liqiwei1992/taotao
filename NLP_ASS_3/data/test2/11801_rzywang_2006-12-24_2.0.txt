This hotel has the worst service I have seen among 5-star hotels. When I asked the conceige to get a taxi for me in the early morning to go to airport, he replied it was too cold out there and I should do that myself. I don't think I will ever stay in this hotel. 

这酒店是我在中国的五星酒店里住过服务最差的一家。当我让保安帮我早上叫一个出租车去机场，他说外面太冷我应该自己去叫。我因为急着赶飞机没有跟他吵，只好自己去找出租车。相信再也不会住这个酒店了。
