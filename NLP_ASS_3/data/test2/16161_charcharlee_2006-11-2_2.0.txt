Location is so so,,  The room is lousy,,,  even with the RMB358 executive room. The room is empty, poor design,   You need to walk up to 2nd floor to get on bed.  Front desk people also smileless,,, they treat people just like &quot; who tell you to come to Motel, people come to motel deserve cold face &amp; eyes&quot;
