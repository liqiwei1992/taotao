i stayed in 套房 which costs RMB640. 
hotel said the room has been renovated in 2005, but still the room is not as nice as the standard room of 天伦万怡大酒店. carpet is dirty and tiolet is only 3 star standard.
the new design hotel lobby and the 39/F restaurant is nice, but the food from the 39/F restaurant is not upto standard.
service of the front desk is also poor.
one of the funny thing is my room has included 2 breakfast but the front desk only give me one coupon and said another guest has to register to get the 2nd coupon. since i stayed alone, i asked what if i have breakfast with visitor not staying with me, then the front desk replied me that the visitor still has to register first before they will issue the coupon to me. this is so stupid of them as they don't understand i pay for the room and also the two breakfast.
if budget is under RMB600, i still will suggest 天伦万怡大酒店.
