I highly recommend this hotel for the tourist or business trip to Nanning as the location of the hotel and the view of room are also the best of the town.The hotel was redecorated and really a 5 stars standard. The pity thing is that they do not have gym facility. The services are fine and the receptionists are all polite and professional, they will not treat in different attitude for the Chinese or foreigners.
