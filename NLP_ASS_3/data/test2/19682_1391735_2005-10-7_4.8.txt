The hotel is in the prime location with a walk out to the shore. The service is excellent. I have live there exactly one year ago, and have no regret for the 2nd time around. The morning breakfast (which was included in the room charge) was also nice, the evening walk out from the hotel is the best part of staying in this hotel. The Yan Tai Shang park is right next door with long &quot;bund&quot; facing the yellow sea. The square was really nice with the exception of the music from the loadspeaker, which tends to be too load in the morning, and really kill the sight. The Íûº£Â¥restaurant located cross from the square was also excellent place to enjoy Â³²Ë. In summary and in short, I will definitely go back to that hotel next time I am in town....
