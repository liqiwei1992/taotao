I 'd like to thank you to all of the workers in New Era Hotel of KMG. Almost everyone we met in the hotel, from porter to manager, from floor service to 28th floor restaurant, shows his/her professionalism. Even our lost property has been found and sent to us so quickly, even quicker than we arriving Beijing.

I'll definitely recommend you to all of my friends in Australia and if I visit KMG next time, I will see you again.

Thank you and the best wishes to all of you.

Richard ZHOU and his Wife Jan FENG
