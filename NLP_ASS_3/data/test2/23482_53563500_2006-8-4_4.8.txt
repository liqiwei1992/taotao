I was very pleased with my choice of Prudential Hotel,which provides everything a tourist/traveller would desire:good location,convenient public transportation(MTR is right there under the hotel!!),comfortable stay,good service.The price is also fairly reasonable.I will definitely come back here when I visit HK next time.:-)
