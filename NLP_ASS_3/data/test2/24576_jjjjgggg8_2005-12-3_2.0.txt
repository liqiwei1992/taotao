Worst Shangri-la I ever stayed.
The front desk made a mistake on billing arrangement, with letting me, they &quot;secrectly&quot; back charged my credit, despite the fact that they are the one making the mistake and they had all my contact info.
Never stay at this hotel as you never know what they will do behind your back.
