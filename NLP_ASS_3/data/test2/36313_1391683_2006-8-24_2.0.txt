receptionist is rude and unflexible. Front Desk cannot change foreign currency for me. When i have b'fast in the restaurant, cannot sign room number.  Only cash or credit card.  But the card machine didnot work.  The waitress swape my card at front desk after i got mad. Room is clean and quite. But hotel environment is crowded and noisy.
