In a big city this hotel is about a 2-star hotel. Our room had flsies constantly even hotel staff were not able to get rid off. No laundary service, no hot water....The hotel is the the most disappointing part of this trip. Please be warned, don't bring heavy bags with you or you'll have to carry them for more than 2.5 KM from the cable car station- White Goose Station, on a rather difficult mountain road.
