I had been worked in Nanjing for more than 14 years, being a typical 5 star hotel, I do prefer Jinling Hotel especially its service. In all aspects it was the best, however it appears a little bit old for its hardware and surroundings now. And even for its software, there might be also could be some slight modification. 
Anyway, I will still choose the Jinling hotel for my future visit. I would like to see it's getting better and better.
