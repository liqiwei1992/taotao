Not so good, local visa was not work. called hotel taxi to airport was RMB150.00 (taxi is RMB80.00) and cannot signed to the room expense. the water closet in the toilet can be moved and some waste water flow out (but not so much). the breakfast is very bad. However, the room is big enough. I booked one big bed single room but gave me 2 beds room.
