i checked in on Dec, 9th 2005 with temperture somewhere around zero and it was a big shocker for me to find out that this hotel doesn't provide hot water after 9pm nor provide any heat in the room.oh, and the so called free breakfast was 2 pieces of bread, 1 piece of ham and a cup of coffee.I moved to another hotel next day.
