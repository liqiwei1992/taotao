This is a horrible hotel, I order room service, porridge, which is black in colour, after 1/3 bowl, I give up. And after few hours, I have loose bowels, and the three following days, I can't eat anything. I suppose if any guest need to order porridge,they just get it from the bowl of porridge leave from the morning breakfast.
