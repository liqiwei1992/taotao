Hotel room is spacious.  The varieties of breakfast is good but all fun and need wait 10 mins for seating.  Although there is seating, the whole family of 6 people need separate two tables.  The soup of noodles are running out and no refill but other than that was fine.  Location is a bit far from the town and the river view is not the case same as picture.  In conclusion, it's also a recommended hotel in Hangzhou.
