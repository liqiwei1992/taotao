This is the worst 4-star hotel I had ever stayed at, I stayed in that hotel on 16 Sept evening, and told them to wake up up at 6am to catch up the transportation to Huangshan, however, the phone never range, I got up and immediately phoned them, asked them why they didnt wake us up, they said they were too busy so they forgot, how can a 4-star hotel be so unreliable like this?
