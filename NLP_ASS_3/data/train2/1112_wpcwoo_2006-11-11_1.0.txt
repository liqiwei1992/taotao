Very bad hotel, no service and front desk has no smile at all. Hotel room temperture set too high and the AC control does not work at all. If you can stand 28-30 degree tempture in your room with no air, then apy your money to stay. Any way , this hotel does not worth the money. The only good thing is they will send you a fan to your room at midnight. What a joke for a four star hotel like this.........
Will never stay in this hotel again.
