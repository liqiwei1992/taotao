This is a very nice hotel. Nice rooms, very nice bathrom with both bathtub and separate shower. Lovely Chinese painting-lined halls. Nice buffet breakfast for 68 yuan. Very good service, very clean. Great location at the very top of Wang Fu Jing. The staff is all new so everyone is still a trainee, but they all try very hard and it shows.
