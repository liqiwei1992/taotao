This should be a 2 star rating hotel. It is worst than some 1 star hotel ....Very poor service and the hotel is very dirty ( both hall way and room ). Carpet in the room is so dirty and amke me sick. I don't think they ever shampoo it at all.
The front desk staffs were so bad, has a attitude problem. I will never never recommand and check in this hotel in the future.Overall experience is BAD BAD BAD............
