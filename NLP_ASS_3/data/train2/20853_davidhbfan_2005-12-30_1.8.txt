The room is very tiny for 500 RMB. It definitely does not give you the feel of 4 star hotel. The three star hotel in Tianjin is much better than this one. The TV is very small and unstable. There were a couple of nights that I cannot even get it turned on. What is most frustrating was when kids and I returned to hotel from the park, we were locked out. I phoned the front desk and was told that someone would show up to help. But no one came in 5 min. I had to go down stairs to check on my self. It turned out that the magnet strip on the key is wearing out and lost effect. The environment is poor in that this hotel is surrounded by residential neighborhood. road is under construction. It is by no means a 4 star hotel. To be fair, I would say that the hotel is clean and there is Walmart close by that we went and did some shopping which was fun.
