1) On 9/12/2005 when I left the hotel with a taxi the bell boy wrote down the registration plate# of the taxi but when I forgot my luggage in the taxi and called back asked for the help the hotel gave me a wrong registration plate# and refused to help me to find the taxi driver who took my luggage(has my digital camera and all my coltes) and simply left me helpless. I am extremely disappointed about this 5 star hotel with a zero star service. I will never go back to this hotel again.
2) by the way the water in the bathroom is not hot spring water.
