It is the worst hotel I have been. Room is cold and stink. Service is really terrible. No one to answer. No bell boy willing to pick up my baggage. People are sleeping in the front desk or watchin TV. Even though breakfast was free, nothing to eat. When I leave, I asked the bell boy to take a taxi, surprisingly he told me to take it by myself. And give me good advice to take it in the main load! What a kind service is it!
