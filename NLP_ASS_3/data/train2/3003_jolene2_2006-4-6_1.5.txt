Don't stay in the &quot;new&quot; building, it's not new at all and 
it's so noisy since the rooms are facing the back of 
surrounding hotels, the machines are running day and night!
The only reason we had to stay there was because there were
no rooms available in the &quot;main&quot; building and no rooms in
Rui-Jin Guesthouse which we prefer and moved to after 2 nights.
