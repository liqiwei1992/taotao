The room is relative large but OLD.

The service is not justifiable as for a 5-star hotel. The housekeeping guy who picked up my laundry bag carried a box of cigarette in the pocket of his shirt - therefore I presumed that he was smoking when he was working with the housekeeping and laundry - which is really bad.

The breakfast is just so so and obviously not up to the standard of a 5-star.
