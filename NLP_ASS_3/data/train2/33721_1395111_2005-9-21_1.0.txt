This is one of the worst hotel I ever stayed! The service is horrible. Can you imagine that you need to deposite 50 yuans to borrow umbrella from the bell boy?  
The front desk also very bad, can you imagine that they need over 30 minutes to do the check out when they do not have a bottle of drink in the refrigerator?
