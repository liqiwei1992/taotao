This is the most DISAPPIONTING part of the journey! Heater out of service during winter!!!  Been asking for help since 3pm in the afternoon, no one cares, keep trying to tell us, the heater is workable.  When we request for extra blankets, they said no extra.  We wanna change room, they said fully booked.  We have tried all kind of ways to tell them that the heater is not workable!  Unfortunately, they only bother to care for us when it reached 7pm (we have been freezing for 4 odd hours) and when we start to yell and shout at them.  Testing our limit. Still the manager come and tell us the heater is workable, we wanna bring the manager to the other room next door to show him what is call workable heater and what is not?  He dare not. what he only say is: we are sorry, it is just like that!  final solution to it, we yell and shout and threaten, finally at nearly 8pm, they provide us with two extra blankets (thought they said no extra blankets? or they are lazy to give to us???).
