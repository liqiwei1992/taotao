Very Poor room, facility and service. Don't try this hotel and this is not a 5 start hotel. This doesn't worth RMB 1,000. Dirty and unhygienic. Dont't try this hotel. I stay there this weekend for 2 days, it is a horrible experience. I prefer to stay in Holiday Inn than this. I hope CTRIP can take this hotel out from the list.
