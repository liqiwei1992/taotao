This hotel sucks! You are not allowed to check out earlier than your booking otherwise they charge you days you booked, rather than days you stayed. Payment is terrible that they treat you as thiefs in restraurants, pools, and bars. Service very bad. Don't stay there if you can choose somewhere else.
