This hotel is too old and is really rated 1 star according to their setting.
Hallway smells, room carpet is so dirty and the worst part is the hotel is try to save energy and does not turn on the central air. In September the weather is still hot and the room is no air condition. So you are paying four star hotel price and getting a one star hotel service.
This is my second time stay in this hotel and I will not book this hotel again.
