This is the worst hotel I've stayed.  The room is old and dirty, and the food and room service is bad.  They don't have fork for spaghetti served.  They charge me for dirty the face towel with the spaghetti sauce.  The foot massage lady keep on asking you to pay her for sex transaction, even I have rejected and she is still keep on pursuading until I have to chase her out.  I will never come to stay in this hotel any more.
