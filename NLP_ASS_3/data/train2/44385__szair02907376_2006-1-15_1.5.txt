very poor hotel, especially the service.

The hotel is not convenience. I asked somebody to call the taxi, the guy said I were not represent to call the taxi, you found the bell boy but I did not know where he went.

When I checked out on 7:00am, the bell boy asked whether I need to call taxi to airport 3 times even though I said no 3 times.

very poor sevice. the breakfast is rubbish.

1 star service, 4 stars charge
I will not come back
