We stayed in Rm 223 of building C.  We booked a regular room but were arranged into a spacious ground floor, almost twice as big as a regular room.  The beach is wonderful as it has a finer grind of sand. Breakfast buffet has a large selection and variety of food for almost everyone.  Bill boys are very professional and warm.  Althought we did not use any of the pool, but many were having lots of fun in the many different pools even in a not so warm water temperture.  We asked for a late check out and we got it! at 3pm.  All in all, a wonderful beautiful place for vacation, service is great.  People are as warm as the weather there in Resort Intime, we highly recommend it.  We stayed from 12/25/2005 to 12/29/2005.
