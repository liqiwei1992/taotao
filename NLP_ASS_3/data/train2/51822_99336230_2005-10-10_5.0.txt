This is an excellent hotel with outstanding servce, worthy of its five star rating.  My wife got a cold, and the maid immediately brought herbal tea to help relieve some of the symptoms.  They also offerred to bring up breakfast.  Laundry is done quickly and well.

The hotel is near the shopping area of Shenyang.  We can reach most places in Shenyang by taxi by using only RMB 7 to RMB 14.
