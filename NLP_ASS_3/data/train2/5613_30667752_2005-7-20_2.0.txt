The hotel room is old adn dirty with no bath rob, the front desk services is terriable they don't have smile and they don't point the directions for you. The coffee shop services is so lousy no matter is for breakfast or for drinks. the lobby bar services is also a mass. If is not their location, I would not want to stay.
