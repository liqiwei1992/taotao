We checked in on Jan 2, 2005. we can not go to sleep, as the air condition can not bring me warm. In the mroning 5:00AM, we hav to get up. The lock was broken when I try to open the door. I have to endure cold wind ourdoor for 30miniutes for another room. Too muc long wait!!!Furthermore, 25yuan have to be paid as compensation I am very angry on it!! But can say nothing, as it is not belong to hotels assiciation credited by 96315 organization or local Tourism burea. The lock is  very bad quality, but I have to pay for their bad quality. Too bad service. It is unfair for customers.
