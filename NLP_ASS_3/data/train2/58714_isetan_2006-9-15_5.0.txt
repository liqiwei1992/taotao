My stay at the Gloria Plaza Hotel was superior in every way.  The room was large, clean, and comfortable and the service from the front desk to the concierge to the restaurants was helpful and gracious. My only small criticism concerns the bathroom:  better and brighter lighting is needed.  It was a pleasure to stay there and I will certainly book this hotel again the next time I visit Xi'an.
