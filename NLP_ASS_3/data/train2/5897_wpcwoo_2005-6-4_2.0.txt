Service is just ok, price right in the middle but the room is very very small. That is no room to walk around, for one person is ok.......
You can also hear music beat all till 3:00 AM so if you want a quiet place don't stay in this hotel.
This hotel only wroth 2 to 2.5 star. Ctrip is over rated this hotel.
I will never go by CTrip's star rating system. It seems to be not matching the normal rating.
