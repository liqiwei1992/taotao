The hotel is well equipped and it seems that all the staff work hard, though the hotel has long way to go to become what its name sounds - &quot;international hotel&quot;. Currently only one Chinese credit card is allowed to use in the hotel and the shower/bath is very difficult due to lack of hot and cold water. I reckon that the management and training would be the areas they need work on urgently in order to make the hotel attractive to public.
