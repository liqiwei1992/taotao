This is the most worst &amp; horrible hotel that I had lived in.
1. I had complaint to the hotel a number of times that the room was very hot and wanted to have improvement. But, there is nothing.
2. The hotel asked to live the most expense room because of my early arrival.
3. The hotel is too old and bad services. The price is seem too high.
