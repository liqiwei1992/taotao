Excellent service and facilities in the room, very clean. Check-in and Check-out are fast and convenient. The location is great, very easy to walk around to the Huayuan and Shanhua temples. The hotel also recommended to me a great taxi driver. The 2nd floor restaurant is good too,high quality food with very low price. Highly recommended!The negative word I might say about it is the bed is a little bit too hard.
