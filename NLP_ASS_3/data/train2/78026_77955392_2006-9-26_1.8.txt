I booked this hotel because of all the good comments on this page, but it was such a disappointment. First of all, they don't accept international credit cards. When I entered the room, it was so hot; the windows were all opened. I tried to close them but there was always a gap between the windows, and it took more than 3 hours for the aircon to cool down the room. There was no broadband internet connection inside the room as claimed. Even the business centre does not provide internet service. I changed to another hotel after one night stay.
