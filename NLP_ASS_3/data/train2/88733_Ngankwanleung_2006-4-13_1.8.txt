receiption service very very bad. 
1, i booked the rail ticket from hotel but they did not delivery the tickets to me on time, delay 5 hours.
2, credit card always can't use .
3, inside the room, have a strong smell from toliet.
4, LCD TV not good, can't control the sounds easily for different channel.

anyway, i won't live in that hotel anymore even it is free of charge.
