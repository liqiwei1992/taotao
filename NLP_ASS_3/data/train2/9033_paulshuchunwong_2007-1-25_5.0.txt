I stayed in this hotel in December 2006. It is a great hotel.  I am impressed by their exceptional services.  The staff are friendly , helpful and polite.  The room is very clean and tidy. A hotel with 5 Star rating at a very reasonable room rate. I'll certainly stay in this hotel for my future trips.
