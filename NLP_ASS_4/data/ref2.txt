australia reopened manila embassy
( agence france-presse , manila , 2nd ) - australia reopened its embassy in the philippines today . the embassy was closed seven weeks ago after what was described as a specific threat of a terrorist attack .
philippine foreign department said in a statement that australian ambassador to manila ruth pearce phoned philippine foreign secretary blas ople to announce the resumption of full operations of the embassy .
canada and the european union , which both shut down their embassies like australia on november 28 , have reopened their embassies earlier this week .
ople said all three ambassadors expressed satisfaction with the enhanced security measures adopted by the philippine government .
the closure of the embassies had angered the philippine government , which said that the alleged threats were exaggerated and the closure of embassies harmed the image of philippines .
manila had once relieved the duty of a police intelligence official because he leaked unverified intelligence about terrorist threats on australian and canadian embassies .
the european union office is in the same building as the australian embassy .
at the time around the anniversary of the 911 terrorist attacks in united states , western diplomatic missions across southeast asia have closed their doors one after the other because of threats related to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization and its regional allies .
australian foreign minister : north korea 's bad behavior could not win more aid
( agence france-presse , sydney , 2nd ) - australia called for a concerted international effort to convince north korea that it cannot win more aid or other concessions by defying the nuclear non-proliferation agreement or through other " bad behavior " .
australian foreign minister alexander downer said today that pyongyang 's decision to restart a controversial nuclear facility and expel united nations inspectors was obviously aimed at forcing international community to make concessions in aid and trade .
australia is one of the several countries that have diplomatic relations with north korea .
" we believe what north korea wants to do is to violate the agreed framework put into place in 1994 , such as to obtain concessions , aid and trade etc. from other countries in the world , including the united states , " downer said .
" we want to raise a point to north korea and it is a very important point . bad behavior is not going to be rewarded , " downer said during an interview by australia broadcasting corporation .
" the kind of behavior , like expelling united nations inspectors and reactivating the yongbyon nuclear facility , will only cause the international community to hold back their supports , " he said .
" it is going to create an opposite effect . we hope that diplomatic measures are going to be effective . "
" on the other hand , if we are to overreact , we will fall into north korea 's trap .
we do not want to do that . "
downer said australia is working closely with the united states and other key allies to force north korea to revoke its recent steps for restarting a previously frozen nuclear program .
" what we want to do is to ensure that international community adopts a common countermeasure . we do not want any uncoordinated and ad hoc responses , " he said .
bush defends his economic stimulus plan
( agence france-presse , washington , 6th ) - u.s. president george w . bush vowed that his upcoming economic stimulus plan would benefit the " working class " and not just the wealthy . people generally believe the wealthy ones will benefit most from bush 's plan , which pushes for a substantial cut in taxes .

whether the plan can go through smoothly is generally viewed as a foretaste of the battle in the 2004 u.s. presidential election . democrats accused that president bush 's blueprint will only give the rich additional splendor and is unlike the democrat 's proposed plan , which tries to send the poor charcoals during a snowy weather .
the eight-point democratic proposal revolved around a us $ 136 billion incentive package to stimulate consumer spending . over 10 years , the democratic plan would cost us $ 100 billion .
" this is a fair , fast-acting and fiscally sound plan , " said nancy pelosi , the democratic leader in the house of representatives , during a joint press conference with other opposition congress members .
bush led the white house to retort outsiders ' allegations that the plan only benefits the rich . bush said the economic stimulus plan , that he is going to unveil , focuses on " stimulating economic vitality and growth " .
bush said , " this plan will provide tax cuts and concessions to the working class .
the plan recognizes that people can only spend money when they have more money to spare . it is only then will more jobs be created . "

homestore 's chief operating officer john giesecke and ex-chief financial officer joseph shew have also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud .

north korea withdrew from nuclear non-proliferation treaty and becomes a foe of the world
( agence france-presse , washington , 15th ) - the showdown between united states and north korea has elevated from a side issue of " axis of evil " to an international crisis . it appears that the global efforts for nuclear non-proliferation in the past several decades are likely to fall short of success for lack of a final effort .
pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty on the 10th of this month and is poised to confront with washington .
analysts said the global endeavor and attempt to curb nuclear proliferation have the fear of a failure . the treaty was already seriously damaged when non-treaty countries , pakistan and india , joined the nuclear club in 1998 .
four days after pyongyang adopted the aforesaid action , the five permanent members of united nations security council have all taken preemptive diplomatic actions for the crisis .
russia said it would send a special envoy to pyongyang with a proposal to end the stalemate . on the other hand , china suggested to host dialogues for a possible compromise between united states and north korea .
britain and france discussed the crisis in london .
international atomic energy agency warned that it might demand actions by the security council if pyongyang refuses to abandon its nuclear plan .
as to the actions of russia and china , many u.s. observers believed this kind of talks might force moscow and beijing to decide whether to cast a veto vote for north korea .
other countries that might have nuclear capability , for example , iran and libya , are certainly monitoring closely the development of the north korea crisis .
they would be interested to know whether north korea can withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty without any penalty , or would united states offer huge sums to north korea in exchange for a cessation in nuclear weapon development .
" if north korea is considered to have the ability to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , then these countries may contemplate that they could also adopt the same action without paying any price , " said robert einhorn , former assistant secretary of state for weapon non-proliferation .
